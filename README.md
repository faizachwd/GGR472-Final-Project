# Retail Food Access in Mississauga: A Web Map
### Mapping Mississauga’s Retail Food Environment in Conjunction with Demographic Characteristics and Access to Transit at the Dissemination Area Level

This website displays maps depicting the density of healthy retail food options within the city of Mississauga at the dissemination area level alongside maps of MiWay bus stops, the percentage of the population above 65 and ethnocultural diversity within the city. Our objective was to empower NGOs like Nucleus Living with relevant data driven information to help target their outreach and community interventions, educate community organizers and local stakeholders about potential vulnuerable populations and provide researchers an added persepective on food insecurity in Mississauga. 


The specific metrics visualized alongside their data sources are:

Canadian Food Environment Dataset (Can-FED):
    -  Modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI) which measures the proportion of retail options that sell fresh and healthy food within a 3km buffer
    - Absolute density is not reported, instead the densities are grouped and ranked 1-4. Group 1 contains the lowest absolute densities and group 4 contains the highest absolute densities.

Census 2016:
    - The percentage of people that do not an official language as their mother tongue
        - Mother Tongue: “[...] the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the person” (Statistics Canada, 2016 Census), used as a proxy for ethnocultural diversity
    - The percentage of people that are above 65

MiWay Bus Stops
    - All the bus stops part of Missausagas public transit system
