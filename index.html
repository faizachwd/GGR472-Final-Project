        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>In a recent Statistics Canada report, a staggering population of 54,000 households were
            identified as food insecure due to financial constraints that limited their ability to purchase nutritious
            meals (Tarasuk et al., 2021). Our web map aims to understand the barriers that residents face when trying to access
            food locally across the city of Mississauga. With our partners at Nucleus Independent Living, our goal is
            to design an interactive map that will help users identify hotspots and better understand access
            to healthy food options among specific neighbourhoods and communities in Mississauga, Ontario. We hope community engagement and non-profit organizations can
            reference this map to help create better solutions to tackle food insecurity and use it in their
            social programming.</p>

                    <p>The Canadian Food Environment Dataset (Can-FED) analyzes the retail food environment in Canada. It includes data on 19 types of food outlets, such as grocery stores and fast-food restaurants, organized by dissemination areas (DA). Key metrics include the Modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI) and Fast-Food Restaurant Mix (Rmix), which measure access to healthy food and the proportion of fast-food outlets, respectively.</p>
